# **Investment Tracker**  
**Allvue Technical Assessment**

## **Overview**  

The **Investment Tracker** is a web application built with ASP.NET Core, designed to help users efficiently manage their investments. It enables tracking of investment lots, selling shares using the **FIFO (First In, First Out)** accounting method, and provides critical insights such as profits, cost basis per share, and remaining shares after each sale.

## **Key Features**  

### **Investment Management**
- Add new investment lots with details like:
  - Number of shares.
  - Price per share.
  - Purchase date.
- View a summary of all lots in a clean, tabular format.

### **Selling Shares**
- Sell shares with the **FIFO** method.
- Calculate key metrics:
  1. **Remaining Shares**: Total shares left after the sale.
  2. **Cost Basis**: Per share of sold and remaining shares.
  3. **Profit or Loss**: Total financial gain or loss from the sale.

### **Dashboard Insights**
- Interactive summaries displayed post-sale, showing metrics like remaining shares, cost basis, and profit/loss.

### **Clean Architecture**
- Well-structured separation of concerns with controllers, models, Razor views, and database interactions.
